    'content1' => 'In 2013, more than 1.8 million people were affected by heavy rain and flash floods across 20 Cambodian provinces. Many families did not know the intensity of the rain, nor how it would affect them; they were unprepared and thus there was much natural and economic loss.  Estimates had the total damage and loss caused by the 2013 floods to be $356 million USD, of which 153 million represented the destruction of physical assets (damage) in the affected areas, and 203 million US$ represented estimated losses in production and economic flows.',
    'content2' =>'During and after the floods that year, People in Need and consortium partners, through the ECHO Flood Recovery Project, provided direct emergency response and rehabilitation services to 343,942 individuals worth â‚¬979,561. Although the Flood Recovery project provided much needed assistance to affected communities, People in Need decided to go beyond emergency response and move towards resilience building and in 2014/2015 in partnership with NCDM and funded thought the DIPECHO program, launched the early warning dissemination system EWS 1294.',
    'content3' => ' Since that time EWS 1294 has seen continuous growth and expansion.  It is currently fully active in 6 disaster prone provinces (Banteay Meachey, Battambang, Siem Reap, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, and Kampot) with over 50,000 active registered users. Each Provincial Departments of Disaster Management (PCDM) has access to a custom database which highlights potential disaster threats and allows them to record and send messages directly to those individuals who are living in the most at risk areas.   Additionally, based on an official letter from the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Telephone Regulars of Cambodia (TRC)  the system has been recognized as an front line emergency phone service in which all mobile providers are required to make freely available to all their customers. NCDM and PIN plan to further expand the system making the system fully available to the whole country of Cambodia by the end of 2018. ',
