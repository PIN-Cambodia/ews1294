    'about_ews' => 'Following continual flooding in many provinces in 2013, then Cambodia National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) was looking for methods to provide an Early Warning System for the people of Cambodia in natural disaster situations. The Early Warning System (EWS) 1294 was initially piloted in 2014 in Pursat, Banteay Meanchey, and Kampong Thom Province. Initial piloting of the system was supported by European Commission Humanitarian Office and Civil Protection Programme (DIPECHO) and set up in partnership with the NCDM, People in Need (PIN), ActionAid and Open Institute. The short code 1294 was officially assigned by Ministry of Post and Telecommunication and the Telephone Regulators of Cambodia (TRC) as an emergency phone number on the 8th July 2014 through an official letter sent to NCDM(Annex A). In this letter, the TRC offcial letter sent to NCDM (Annex A).  In this letter, the required all Mobile Network Operators(MNOs) to  send and receive calls via this number free of charge In order to accommodate the limited literacy capabilities of the rural population of Cambodia and to allow for a lack of Khmer font support on mobile phones, it was decided to use an Interactive Voice Response(IVR) platform to send warning messages during emergencies. With the assistance of local software developers, People in Need has now built its own customised IVR system, with the UNICEF RapidPro call flow manager to help design the structure of the system registrations. As of November 2016, over 44,000 individuals have subscribed to receive voice base early warning messages through the EWS System. Since 2015, we have sent warning messages on four separate occasions on behalf of the NCDM, warning people of dangerous incoming storm fronts. As xxxxx from the Pursat Provincial Commmittee for Disaster Management(PCDM) say,xxxxxxxx. In order to improve the speed and efficiency of the Early Warning Messaging System, People in Need have partnered with DAI from the US to develop water level detectors, which are currently being trialled in Kampot and Pursat Provinces. These devices detect rising water levels and send automatic warnings in times of emergency to registered EWS 1294 users in the surrounding areas, warning them of potential flood situations. With further funding provided by DIPECHO and UNESCAP, the Early Warning System is also now going to be expanded into a further 10 Provinces, covering the most vulnerable areas in the country. By the end of 2017, EWS 1294 is expected to over 100,000 registered users. The EWS will continue to provide assistance in time of emergency to the people of Cambodia.',
